# Stilbaai Tourism Web Portal (Sanitized)

This repository contains a sanitized copy of a web portal created for Stilbaai Tourism. The unsanitized version has its own private repo.

The source code for this version is identical to the main version; the only difference is that all API Keys, connection strings, and a JSON file containing Firebase authentication have been manually removed.

**Important Note:** This version cannot run as there is a missing file containing Firebase authentication, which has been intentionally removed. Additionally, it will not function as the connection string to interact with the database and the authentication service has been removed.

## Application Framework

This web application was made using ASP.MVC core MVC in Visual Studio 2022. This was chosen as it was familiar and had tight integration with Azure and Auth0.

## About the applicaiton

This web application was made for a collage course called Work Integrated Learning (XBCAD7319). The goal was to approach an NGO and develop a system for them. My group approached an NGO called Stilbaai Tourism and decided to develop a mobile application and a web portal to populate the database the mobile app uses.
