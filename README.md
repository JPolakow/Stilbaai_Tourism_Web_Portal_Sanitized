# Stilbaai_Tourism_Web_Portal_Sanitized
Sanitized copy of a web portal created for Stilbaai Tourism

The source code of this version and the main version are identical, the difference is that I have manually removed all API Keys, Connection string and a JSON file containing Firebase authentication.

The original web portal contains API keys and connection strings to private Firebase, WordPress, MySQL, and Auth0. 

PLEASE NOTE: this version cannot run, there is a missing file I manually removed that contained Firebase authentication. It also will not function as the connection string to interact with the database and the authentication service has been removed.
